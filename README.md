# political-survey
POLI 209 political science class project using self-collected survey data

This project was for a class
I collected survey data ("SurveyData.csv") from the UNC Chapel Hill community (peers, staff, etc) and analyzed the results
Load in the data and you should be able to run all the code top to bottom to see the types of analyses I did
I also created a .rmd file just to be able to create a stargazer table - that is uploaded as well
